### Hyperledger Iroha

Hyperledger Iroha is a business blockchain framework designed to be incorporated into infrastructure projects that need distributed ledger technology. The distributed ledger feature of a blockchain works similar to a shared database, which can allow data to be shared publicly

Features of Iroha


- simple construction, 
- modular, 
- domain-driven C++ design, 
- emphasis on client application development
- crash fault tolerant consensus algorithm, called YAC.




Hyperledger Iroha is an open-source, distributed ledger or blockchain platform, designed and developed by the Hyperledger project. It is one of the several blockchain technologies offered by Hyperledger.

Iroha is written in C++ and focuses on providing a simple, modular, and easy-to-use platform for developers and users alike. Its goal is to provide an efficient and scalable platform for building decentralized applications that require high performance and security.

One of the unique features of Hyperledger Iroha is its use of the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm, which allows it to maintain a high level of fault tolerance and security while still achieving fast transaction processing times. This makes Iroha particularly well-suited for applications that require fast and secure processing of a large number of transactions.

Overall, Hyperledger Iroha is an important project in the Hyperledger ecosystem, providing a robust and flexible platform for building distributed ledger applications.
