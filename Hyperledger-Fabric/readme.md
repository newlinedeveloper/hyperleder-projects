Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source blockchain platform developed by the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger project. It is written in Go and is designed for building enterprise-grade blockchain applications and networks. One of the key features of Hyperledger Fabric is its modular architecture, which allows for flexibility and scalability in the design and deployment of blockchain networks.

Hyperledger Fabric provides a modular architecture that separates the roles of different network participants and allows for pluggable implementations of different components. This includes a modular consensus model, which allows for the use of different consensus algorithms such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Kafka-based consensus.

One of the key components of Hyperledger Fabric is the chaincode, which is a program written in Go, JavaScript, or Java that runs on the network and manages the shared state of the ledger. Chaincode is used to implement the business logic of a blockchain application and is executed on the peers in the network.

Hyperledger Fabric also provides a permissioned network, meaning that only authorized participants are allowed to access and interact with the network. It also supports multiple membership services providers (MSPs) to manage the identity and access control of participants in the network.

Hyperledger Fabric is well suited for building consortium blockchain networks across different industries, such as finance, supply chain, and healthcare. It has been used in various projects and products, such as IBM Blockchain Platform, SAP Leonardo Blockchain, and more.
