Hyperledger Besu is an open-source Ethereum client developed by the Hyperledger community and maintained by the ConsenSys Diligence team. It is written in Java and is designed to be modular, flexible, and configurable. The goal of Hyperledger Besu is to provide a platform for building enterprise-grade applications on top of the Ethereum network.

Features of Hyperledger Besu include:

- Support for Ethereum mainnet, testnets, and private networks
- Support for both Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithms
- Support for privacy and confidentiality through the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and confidential transactions
- Support for smart contract development using Solidity and Vyper programming languages
- Support for various storage options, including RocksDB, LevelDB, and SQLite
- Support for various network protocols, including JSON-RPC, GraphQL, and WebSockets
- Support for pluggable consensus algorithms and network protocols
- Support for integration with other Hyperledger projects, such as Hyperledger Fabric.


Installation & development procedure

Creating a simple application using Hyperledger Besu involves several steps, including setting up a development environment, writing and deploying a smart contract, and interacting with the contract using a web interface or command line. Here is an overview of the process:

- Set up a development environment: To create an application using Hyperledger Besu, you will first need to set up a development environment, which includes installing the necessary software, such as Java, Gradle, and the Hyperledger Besu client.

- Write and deploy a smart contract: Next, you will need to write and deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum network. You can use the Solidity programming language to write the contract, and then use a tool such as Truffle to deploy it to the network.

- Interact with the contract: Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using a web interface or command line. For example, you can use a tool such as Web3.js to interact with the contract through a web interface, or use the JSON-RPC API provided by Hyperledger Besu to interact with the contract through the command line.

- Create a web interface: Finally, you can create a web interface for your application using any front-end development framework such as React.js or Angular.js. You can use the web3.js library to interact with the smart contract from the frontend.
