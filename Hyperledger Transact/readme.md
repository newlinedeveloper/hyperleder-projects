Hyperledger Transact is a project under the Hyperledger umbrella that provides a platform-agnostic framework for developing distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). It is a transaction execution platform that enables developers to build DLT applications with a pluggable and flexible architecture.

Hyperledger Transact uses a "smart contract" approach to DLT development, where a smart contract is a self-contained piece of code that defines the rules of a transaction. Developers can write smart contracts using a variety of programming languages, including Rust, Python, and C++.

Hyperledger Transact provides a set of standard transaction families that can be used as building blocks for developing DLT applications. These transaction families include:

- "IntegerKey," which is a simple key-value store
- "SawtoothSupplyChain," which is a supply chain management system
- "Marketplace," which is a decentralized marketplace

Hyperledger Transact also provides a transaction execution engine that enables parallel processing of transactions, which can improve the performance of DLT applications. Additionally, it includes a pluggable consensus interface, which allows developers to integrate their preferred consensus mechanism.

Overall, Hyperledger Transact aims to make it easier for developers to create scalable and interoperable DLT applications by providing a flexible and modular platform for building and executing smart contracts.



To create a Hyperledger Transact application, you will need to follow these general steps:

- Choose a Hyperledger platform: Hyperledger Transact is designed to work with any Hyperledger platform, such as Hyperledger Sawtooth or Hyperledger Fabric. Choose the platform that best suits your needs and follow the installation instructions.

- Write smart contracts: Use one of the supported programming languages (such as Rust, Python, or C++) to write smart contracts. These contracts define the rules of transactions and can interact with data stored on the ledger.

- Build a transaction processor: A transaction processor is a component that receives transaction requests from clients, validates them, and updates the ledger. To create a transaction processor, you will need to define transaction handlers that specify how to execute each transaction. You will also need to use the Hyperledger Transact SDK to generate the necessary transaction processor code.

- Implement consensus: Choose a consensus mechanism for your Hyperledger platform and configure it according to your requirements. Hyperledger Transact provides a pluggable consensus interface that enables you to use your preferred consensus mechanism.

- Deploy your application: Deploy your Hyperledger Transact application on the chosen Hyperledger platform. This will involve configuring and starting the necessary components, such as the transaction processor, consensus engine, and ledger database.

Hyperledger Transact provides detailed documentation and code examples that can guide you through the process of creating a DLT application using the platform. Additionally, there are many resources available in the Hyperledger community, such as forums and developer groups, where you can get help and advice from other developers.
