Hyperledger Transact is a project under the Hyperledger umbrella that provides a platform-agnostic framework for developing distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). It is a transaction execution platform that enables developers to build DLT applications with a pluggable and flexible architecture.

Hyperledger Transact uses a "smart contract" approach to DLT development, where a smart contract is a self-contained piece of code that defines the rules of a transaction. Developers can write smart contracts using a variety of programming languages, including Rust, Python, and C++.

Hyperledger Transact provides a set of standard transaction families that can be used as building blocks for developing DLT applications. These transaction families include:

- "IntegerKey," which is a simple key-value store
- "SawtoothSupplyChain," which is a supply chain management system
- "Marketplace," which is a decentralized marketplace

Hyperledger Transact also provides a transaction execution engine that enables parallel processing of transactions, which can improve the performance of DLT applications. Additionally, it includes a pluggable consensus interface, which allows developers to integrate their preferred consensus mechanism.

Overall, Hyperledger Transact aims to make it easier for developers to create scalable and interoperable DLT applications by providing a flexible and modular platform for building and executing smart contracts.
